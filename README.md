# Code-Mixed-Kannada-English-Dataset-for-Depression-Detection
This dataset contains code-mixed Kannada-English text data labeled for detecting depressive tendencies. It includes four categories of labels: Depressive, Non-Depressive, Neutral, and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). The dataset can be used for developing machine learning and deep learning models for depression detection using Natural Language Processing (NLP).
The dataset consists of 6,034 total instances, divided into Training, Validation, and Testing subsets for each category.
Within the Depressive class, the dataset also includes sub-categories reflecting various symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) based on DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. These sub-categories include Persistent Sadness or Low Mood (PSLM), Loss of Interest or Pleasure (LIP), and others.
